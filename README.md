# SocialMedia

## Description

The University of Knowledge (UoK) is extremely pleased with the partnership with their students in the development
of their own systems. 
The experience has been shown to be positive to all.
Now, the UoK is planning to create its own social media platform.

## Prerequisites

JAVA 8.0

## Date
Project was finished on 20/04/2021.

## Setup

Unzip the archive. 
Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the java program (HuffmanCoding.java). 
Assume it's C:. 
Type 'javac SocialMedia.java' and press enter to compile your code.
If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line (Assumption: The path variable is set).
Now, type ' java SocialMedia ' to run your program.
You will be able to see the result printed on the window.

## Usage

Social media platforms are increasingly growing in popularity and they are among the most used apps and accessed websites.
Despite being initially designed to promote online social interactions, they are more than connecting people,
they have been used to promote disinformation campaigns, and they are a huge marketplace filled with advertisements
and algorithms pushing you to consume and buy.
The UoK plans to build a very simple social media platform, free of adds and disinformation, focusing on posting
short messages (text only). The users, i.e., accounts registered in the system, will be able to post original messages
and comments, which can also be endorsed by endorsement posts.
